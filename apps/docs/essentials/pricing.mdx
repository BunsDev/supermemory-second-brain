### Free!

Yes, everything is free & open source.
Supermemory is built by [me](https://dhravya.dev), a college student. My life situations make it very difficult and almost impossible to monetise the product.

Any kind of sponsorships / support would mean a lot to me, and help me keep supermemory alive.

You can sponsor on my Github sponsors page - https://github.com/sponsors/dhravya

### How can I trust you?

Making the product free makes it hard to trust. "How will you manage the infra?", "How will you keep the product running?" are very valid questions.

I've got you covered.

Supermemory has the support of [Cloudflare startups program](https://www.cloudflare.com/forstartups/), [Google Cloud startup program](https://cloud.google.com/startups) and grants by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and other amazing companies.

We're fully committed to keeping the product running, and happy to sign any agreements you'd like.
