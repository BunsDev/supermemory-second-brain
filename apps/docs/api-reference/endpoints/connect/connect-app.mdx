openapi: get /connect/{app}

You may connect supermemory to other apps.
when you send a GET request to the \/connect:APP?id= endpoint, you will get a redirectURL. This is a safe URL that your users can click and select the appropriate files with. Once this is done, supermemory will periodically re-fetch and make sure that the data is always fresh.

As of right now, these apps are supported:
- Notion
